### Overview

<p className="my-4">
  SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) is essential for sending emails from your application. Without proper SMTP setup, important features like email verification, password reset, and notifications won't work. This guide will help you configure SMTP settings correctly.
</p>

##### Why SMTP Setup is Important

<p className="my-4">
  - User Registration: New users won't be able to verify their email addresses
  - Password Reset: Users can't receive password reset links
  - Notifications: System notifications and alerts won't be delivered
  - Account Security: Email-based security features won't function
</p>

##### Getting SMTP Credentials from Shared Hosting

<p className="my-4">
Follow these steps to get SMTP credentials from your shared hosting:

1. **Login to cPanel**: Access your hosting control panel
2. **Find Email Section**: Look for "Email Accounts" or "Email Tools"
3. **Get SMTP Details**:
   - SMTP Host: Usually server email like `mail.yourdomain.com` or `smtp.yourdomain.com`
   - SMTP Port: Typically 465 (SSL) or 587 (TLS)
   - Username: Your full email address (e.g., `info@yourdomain.com`)
   - Password: Your email account password

> Popular hosting providers like cPanel usually display these settings in the Email Configuration section. If you can't find it, you can contact your hosting provider's support team for assistance.
