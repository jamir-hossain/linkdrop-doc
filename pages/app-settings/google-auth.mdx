### Credentials Setup

To create Google credentials for OAuth, you'll need to follow these steps:

Go to the Google Cloud Console (https://console.cloud.google.com/) and create a new project by clicking on the project dropdown on the top left corner and then clicking on "New Project".

<ul class="list-decimal pl-6 py-4">
  <li className="py-1.5">
    Once your project is created, go to the "APIs & Services" section from the
    left-hand menu and click on "Credentials".
  </li>
  <li className="py-1.5">
    On the Credentials page, click on "Create Credentials" and select "OAuth
    client ID".
  </li>
  <li className="py-1.5">
    Select the application type as "Web Application" or "Other non-interactive"
    depending on the use case.
  </li>
  <li className="py-1.5">
    Enter a name for your OAuth client ID and enter the authorized redirect URIs
    for your application. The redirect URIs are the URLs to which Google will
    redirect users after they grant/deny access to your application.
  </li>
  <li className="py-1.5">
    Once you've entered all the required information, click on "Create".
  </li>
  <li className="py-1.5">
    You should now see your newly created OAuth client ID. You can view the
    client ID and secret by clicking on the "Edit" button next to the client ID.
  </li>
  <li className="py-1.5">Give your project a name and click on "Create".</li>
</ul>

<p>
  That's it! You now have a Google credential for OAuth that you can use to
  authenticate users and access Google APIs.
