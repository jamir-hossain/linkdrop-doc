### Overview

<p className="my-4">
  Here you will see the all-created pricing plan list. Also, you can create a
  new pricing plan. Creating subscription plans is an essential step in setting
  up your application, as it enables you to offer different pricing options to
  your users based on their needs. To create subscription plans, you can
  navigate to the Pricing Management page in your application and click on the
  `Create Plan` button.

  When you navigate to the Pricing Plan Creation page, you'll need to provide the `Stripe Product ID` and `Stripe Product Price ID`. To do this, first create a product and its associated price in your Stripe account via the Stripe Dashboard. Once the product and price are set up, simply copy the `Product ID` and `Price ID`, then paste them here. The application will automatically fetch all relevant details from the Stripe product, including price, title, description, currency, billing interval, and more.
