### Installation

##### **Step 1:** Download Source Code.

<p className="flex item-center">
  First, you need to purchase the LinkDrop from
  [codecanyon](https://codecanyon.net/item/linkdrop-saas-link-management-tool/43555815).
  After that, you have to download the source code as a zip file from there.
</p>

##### **Step 2:** Upload Source Code.

<p>
  To install LinkDrop on your server, follow these steps:
</p>

<div className="steps-container pt-4">
  <ol className='pl-6 list-disc'>
    <li>Upload the zip file to the server where you want to deploy the app</li>
    <li>Extract the contents of the zip file on your server</li>
    <li>Proceed to configure LinkDrop after extraction is complete</li>
  </ol>
</div>

##### **Step 3:** Create a .env file

<p>
  After extracting the LinkDrop source code on your server, you need to create an environment configuration file:
</p>

<div className="steps-container py-4">
  <ol className='pl-6 list-disc'>
    <li>Locate the .env.example file in the root directory of your extracted files</li>
    <li>Make a copy of this file and rename it to .env</li>
  </ol>
</div>
<p>
  After creating .env file, you need to browse your application using your domain to complete the other critical configuration including database setup, app settings, etc.
</p>

### Necessary Setup

import { Card, Cards } from "nextra-theme-docs";

<p>
  But before completing other installation processes you will need to create a
  database to store its data. After creating the database you have to collect
  the database name, database user name, and database password. This is an
  important step in the installation process, as the database details will be
  required to complete the necessary setup. With your database created and
  configured, you can then proceed to complete the LinkDrop installation and
  begin using its powerful features.
</p>

##### **Step 1:** Server Requirements
<p className="mb-2">
  Now you need to browse your app from browser by your app domain. You will see
  some options to complete your app installation process. Here is the first one
  where you will see the server requirements. If these requirements are
  full-fill then you can go to the next step.

##### **Step 3:** Database Connection
<p className="mb-2">
  Here is the third step, from here you have to connect your database with your
  app. Please put the database name, database username, and database password
  then you need to check the database by `TEST CONNECTION` button click whether
  the database is connected or not.
</p>
<>![](/assets/installation/step-3.png)</>

<p className="mb-2">
  If the database connection is established then you will see the success
  message and you can go to the next step otherwise you can't go to the next
  step and you will see the error message.
