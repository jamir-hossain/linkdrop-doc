### Installation

##### **Step 1:** Download Source Code.

<p className="flex item-center">
  First, you need to purchase the LinkDrop from
  [codecanyon](https://codecanyon.net/item/linkdrop-saas-link-management-tool/43555815).
  After that, you have to download the source code as a zip file from there.
</p>

##### **Step 2:** Upload Source Code.

<p>
  To install LinkDrop on your server, follow these steps:
</p>

<div className="steps-container pt-4">
  <ol className='pl-6 list-disc'>
    <li>Upload the zip file to the server where you want to deploy the app</li>
    <li>Extract the contents of the zip file on your server</li>
    <li>Proceed to configure LinkDrop after extraction is complete</li>
  </ol>
</div>

##### **Step 3:** Create a .env file

<p>
  After extracting the LinkDrop source code on your server, you need to create an environment configuration file:
</p>

<div className="steps-container">
  <ol className='pl-6 list-disc'>
    <li>Locate the .env.example file in the root directory of your extracted files</li>
    <li>Make a copy of this file and rename it to .env</li>
  </ol>
</div>
<p>
  After creating .env file, you need to browse your application using your domain to complete the other critical configuration including database setup, app settings, etc.
</p>

##### **Step 4:** Enable symlink() PHP Function

<p>
  If you're using shared hosting, you'll need to enable the symlink() PHP function for proper application functionality.
</p>

> If the symlink() function is already enabled on your server, you can skip this step.

<p className="mt-4 font-medium">
  Here are common methods to enable it:
</p>
<div className="steps-container">
  <ol className='pl-6 list-decimal'>
    <li>
      <p>Through cPanel:</p>
      <ul className='pl-6 list-disc'>
        <li>Log in to your cPanel account</li>
        <li>Navigate to 'Select PHP Version' or 'PHP Settings'</li>
        <li>Look for 'symlink' in the list of PHP extensions</li>
        <li>Enable the checkbox next to it</li>
        <li>Save the changes</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Through PHP.ini (if you have access):</p>
      <ul className='pl-6 list-disc'>
        <li>Create or edit php.ini in your root directory</li>
        <li>Add the line: <code>enable_function = symlink</code></li>
        <li>Save the file and restart PHP if required</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p>Through Hosting Support:</p>
      <ul className='pl-6 list-disc'>
        <li>Contact your hosting provider's support team</li>
        <li>Request them to enable the symlink() PHP function</li>
        <li>Specify it's needed for Laravel application</li>
        <li>Wait for their confirmation</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ol>
</div>



### Necessary Setup

<p>
  But before completing other installation processes you will need to create a
  database to store its data. After creating the database you have to collect
  the database name, database user name, and database password. This is an
  important step in the installation process, as the database details will be
  required to complete the necessary setup. With your database created and
  configured, you can then proceed to complete the LinkDrop installation and
  begin using its powerful features.
</p>

##### **Step 1:** Server Requirements

  some options to complete your app installation process. Here is the first one
  where you will see the server requirements. If these requirements are
  full-fill then you can go to the next step.
